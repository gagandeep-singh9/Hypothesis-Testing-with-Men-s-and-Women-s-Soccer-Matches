# âš½ Goals in Men's vs. Women's FIFA World Cup Matches

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project analyzes official **FIFA World Cup matches since 2002** to answer a fascinating question:

ðŸ‘‰ **Are more goals scored in womenâ€™s international soccer matches than menâ€™s?**

Using **statistical testing** and **visual analysis**, the distributions of goals scored per match were compared.  

âœ… The results show that **womenâ€™s matches tend to have significantly more goals on average than menâ€™s matches**, and this difference is unlikely to be due to chance (at a 10% significance level).

This finding supports the common perception that womenâ€™s international soccer is generally more high-scoring, offering valuable insights for fans, analysts, and media discussions.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Python 3** â€“ core analysis environment  
- **Pandas** â€“ data cleaning & manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** â€“ visualizing goal distributions  
- **Pingouin** â€“ statistical tests  
- **SciPy** â€“ alternative Mann-Whitney implementation

## ðŸ“š Lessons Learned
- âš¡ **Data filtering is key** â€” ensuring only official FIFA World Cup matches (excluding qualifiers) gave more meaningful results.  
- ðŸ“Š **Distributions matter** â€” real sports data often isnâ€™t normally distributed, making non-parametric tests the right choice.  
- ðŸŽ¯ **Significance levels shape interpretation** â€” even a 10% threshold can reveal important differences in competitive sports contexts.

## âœ… Conclusion
Womenâ€™s World Cup matches since 2002 feature **more goals on average** than menâ€™s, making them statistically more high-scoring contests.
