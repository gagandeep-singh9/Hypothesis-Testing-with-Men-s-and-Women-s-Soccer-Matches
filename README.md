⚽ Goals in Men's vs. Women's FIFA World Cup Matches

📊 An investigation into whether women’s matches produce more goals than men’s.

ℹ️ Overview

This project analyzes official FIFA World Cup matches since 2002 to answer a simple but fascinating question:

👉 Are more goals scored in women’s international soccer matches than men’s?

Using statistical testing and visual analysis, the distributions of goals scored per match were compared. The results indicate that women’s matches tend to have significantly more goals on average than men’s matches, and this difference is unlikely to be due to chance (at a 10% significance level).

This finding supports the common perception that women’s international soccer is generally more high-scoring, offering valuable insights for fans, analysts, and media discussions.

📚 Lessons Learned

⚡ Data filtering is key — ensuring only official FIFA World Cup matches (excluding qualifiers) gave more meaningful results.

📊 Distributions matter — real sports data often isn’t normally distributed, making non-parametric tests the right choice.

🎯 Significance levels shape interpretation — even a 10% threshold can reveal important differences in competitive sports contexts.

✅ Conclusion: Women’s World Cup matches since 2002 feature more goals on average than men’s, making them statistically more high-scoring contests.
